# PRD — <product name>

## Target SaaS
<which SaaS we're killing — name, URL, what it does in one line>

## Kill mode
<internal replacement (stop paying, own the data, fit our workflow) | competing product (sell it) — and what that implies for scope>

## Why kill it
<what it costs, what it does badly for us, what we don't need from it>

## Problem
What need, for whom, why now.

## Target users
Profiles, usage context. (Internal replacement: the actual team. Competitor: the segment.)

## Perimeter — the 20% that matters
### Replicated (core loop)
| Feature | Complexity (1-5) | Why this score |
|---|---|---|
| <feature> | <n> | <...> |

Scale: 1 trivial CRUD · 2 form + persistence + list · 3 business logic / several states · 4 integrations, payments, roles · 5 real-time, migrations, external systems. A 5 is a graveyard candidate — keep it only if it IS the core value.

### Explicitly NOT replicated (graveyard)
<what we deliberately drop — be exhaustive, this list kills scope creep>

### The angle (done differently / better)
<where we beat the target, beyond parity>

## Constraints
Technical, time, dependencies.

## Success criteria
<parity checklist on the perimeter + the angle. Measurable.>
