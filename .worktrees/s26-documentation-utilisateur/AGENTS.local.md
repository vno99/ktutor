# ktutor — settings and conventions

**This file is yours. `install.sh` never overwrites it, and `/ks-setup` is its only creator.**
`AGENTS.md` belongs to the method and is rebuilt on every update — write nothing there.

Every value below is read by the pipeline commands. One setting per line, `Name: value`, nothing
else on the line: a command reads the value as everything after the colon, trimmed. Change any of
them at any time.

**After changing anything here, rerun `install.sh`** — it reassembles `AGENTS.md` from the method's
rules plus this file, and `AGENTS.md` is what an agent loads automatically. Settings are also read
straight from here, so those take effect immediately; the conventions at the bottom only reach an
agent through `AGENTS.md`, and stay stale until you reinstall.

A command left at `—` is one the agents cannot run: they say so rather than guess one.
